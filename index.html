                      <b> ðŸ’¥Nexus of Economics, Data and Technology in AI:</b> <br> I am currently working on addressing the Economic Viability of AI driven <br> technologies  in real-life applications (such as Healthcare, Finance,   and <br> Smart Cities). 
                            Developments in AI driven technologies (such as Machine Learning <br> and Internet-of-Things) are palying a vital role in human lives. I intends to <br> investigate such AI driven technologies from the lenses of Economics.<br> <br>
                              
                       <b> ðŸ’¥Time-series analysis of financial data: </b> <br>
                       Let's go back to my PhD work for better understanding of my portfolio. During my PhD, I developed statistical models to analyse the data obtain from financial entities, ranging from year 1979-2014. 
                       The title of my thesis was Relationship of Macroeconomics variables on financial sector. I developed Econometric models, which predicted the behaviour of Economy through macroeconomic variables.
                       For instance, In a layman's term, we all know that oil prices affects a state economy quite significantly. Sharp rise and fall in oil prices puts major stress over the financial entities of state.
                       Through my designed Econometric models, the financial entities will have improved understiding of future events. In my thesis, I identified major variables, and by leveraging the advantage of probability theory 
                       and state-of-the-art Econometric solvers such as e-Views and STATA, I developed successful models that predicted the relationship of variables with more than 90% accuracy. Although, during my PhD I focussed on 
                       statistical modelling; however, as the data is increasing due to various industrail and urban applications, Machine Learning and IoT will have a significant role in our society. Such techniques allow better understanding 
                       of coplex systems, and from Economics prespective, Economic viability is a major critieri for companies, that would like to enter in the field. <br> 
                       For past contributions, see "Publications". Besides research, I worked as TA for several masters and PhD courses on Economics, Finance, and Portfolio Management. <br> <br>
